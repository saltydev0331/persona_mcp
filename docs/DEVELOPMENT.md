# Development Log - Persona MCP Server

A detailed log of the development process, decisions, and lessons learned.

## Session Overview

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Duration**: ~3 hours  
**Outcome**: Working MCP server with persistent conversation context

## Initial Requirements

User requested: **"Option A ‚Äî a complete MCP server project structure built entirely in Python, using a minimal, open-source-only stack"**

Key constraints:

- Offline operation (no cloud dependencies)
- Local SQLite + ChromaDB storage
- Ollama LLM integration
- Complete project structure

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Structure and Models (30 minutes)

**Approach**: Full project scaffolding with enterprise-style architecture

**Created**:

```
persona-mcp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ persona_mcp/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/__init__.py (All Pydantic models)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ persistence/ (SQLite + ChromaDB)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conversation/ (Conversation engine)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ llm/ (Ollama integration)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp/ (Protocol handlers)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ simulation/ (Testing harness - planned)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/ (Test structure)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/ (Test clients)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.py (Entry point)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
```

**Key Decisions**:

- Pydantic for all data models and validation
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Local-first design with no external API dependencies

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (45 minutes)

**Challenge**: Building complete MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 server from scratch

**Implemented**:

- WebSocket server with aiohttp
- JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol compliance
- Two hardcoded personas (Aria - bard, Kira - scholar)
- SQLite database with automatic schema creation
- ChromaDB vector memory integration
- Ollama API client with model verification

**Technical Choices**:

- aiohttp for WebSocket server (over FastAPI WebSocket)
- httpx for async HTTP client to Ollama
- SQLAlchemy Core for database operations
- ChromaDB for vector memory storage

### Phase 3: User Onboarding and Testing (30 minutes)

**Context**: User revealed: _"Honestly, I've never built or used an MCP server before lol"_

**Approach**: Shifted from implementation to education and testing

**Created**:

- Interactive test client (`mcp_client.py`)
- Automated test suite (`quick_test.py`)
- Step-by-step user guidance
- Environment setup assistance

**Lessons**:

- User experience and onboarding are crucial
- Working examples matter more than perfect code
- Testing tools should be part of initial delivery

### Phase 4: Debugging and Fixes (45 minutes)

**Issues Encountered**:

1. **Unicode Display Errors** (Windows console)

   - Problem: Emoji characters in logging caused crashes
   - Solution: Replaced emojis with text labels `[OK]`, `[READY]`

2. **Missing MCP Methods**

   - Problem: Client expected `persona.memory` and `persona.relationship`
   - Solution: Added stub implementations with placeholder responses

3. **Conversation Engine Complexity**

   - Problem: Multi-persona conversation engine too complex for MCP use case
   - Solution: Simplified to direct Ollama API calls for single-persona chats

4. **Pydantic Validation Errors**

   - Problem: `tokens_used` field expecting int but receiving float
   - Solution: Added `int()` conversion in token calculation

5. **Memory Storage Errors**
   - Problem: `importance` field constraint violation (value 3.0, max 1.0)
   - Solution: Changed importance from 3.0 to 0.8

**Debugging Approach**:

- Systematic testing with real client interactions
- Server log analysis for error identification
- Incremental fixes with immediate testing
- User feedback incorporated in real-time

### Phase 5: Conversation Context Implementation (60 minutes)

**User Request**: Noticed lack of conversation memory - personas didn't remember previous exchanges

**Decision**: Implemented "Option 2" - Full conversation session management

**Features Added**:

- **Session Management**: UUID-based sessions per WebSocket connection
- **Per-Persona Conversations**: Separate conversation history for each persona
- **Smart Context Windows**: Keep 20 recent messages, summarize older ones
- **Anti-Bloat Measures**: 24-hour session timeout, automatic cleanup
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Include conversation history in LLM prompts

**Implementation Details**:

```python
# Session state structure
{
    "session_id": "uuid",
    "conversations": {
        "persona_id": {
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "...", "timestamp": "..."}],
            "context_summary": "summary_of_older_messages",
            "turn_count": 42,
            "last_activity": datetime
        }
    }
}
```

**Technical Challenges**:

- Conversation context management without memory bloat
- Seamless persona switching with isolated memory
- Background cleanup of expired sessions
- Prompt engineering with conversation history

### Phase 6: Model Verification (15 minutes)

**User Question**: "How do we figure out if Ollama is actually using the specified model?"

**Investigation**:

- Added detailed logging to show model requests
- Verified Docker Ollama container logs
- Confirmed end-to-end model usage

**Results**:

- ‚úÖ MCP server correctly specifies `llama3.1:8b`
- ‚úÖ Ollama receives and loads the correct model
- ‚úÖ Response verification confirms model usage
- ‚úÖ 6.8-second response time indicates actual model loading (not cached)

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Single Model with Prompt Engineering

**Decision**: Use one model (llama3.1:8b) with personality through prompts
**Rationale**: Simpler, more reliable than model switching
**Result**: Consistent performance with distinct personalities

### 2. Session-Based Context Management

**Decision**: In-memory session storage with background cleanup
**Rationale**: Fast access, automatic resource management
**Trade-off**: Sessions don't survive server restart (acceptable for development)

### 3. Simplified Conversation Flow

**Decision**: Direct Ollama API calls instead of complex conversation engine
**Rationale**: MCP single-persona interactions need different approach than multi-persona
**Result**: Faster responses, easier debugging

### 4. Local-First Architecture

**Decision**: No external dependencies beyond Docker Ollama
**Rationale**: User wanted offline operation
**Benefits**: Predictable environment, no API costs, privacy

### 5. WebSocket vs FastAPI Performance Analysis

**Analysis**: Compared aiohttp WebSocket MCP vs FastAPI HTTP API
**Finding**: WebSocket superior for conversational AI use case
**Reasoning**:

- Persistent connections eliminate HTTP handshake overhead
- Stateful session management keeps conversation context in memory
- Real-time interaction patterns benefit from WebSocket bidirectionality
- LLM generation time (1-7s) dominates protocol overhead
  **Optimization Potential**: Current implementation can scale 10x with targeted optimizations

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Start Simple, Add Complexity

- Initial complex conversation engine was overkill
- Direct implementation often better than abstract frameworks
- Working simple solution beats perfect complex one

### 2. User Testing is Critical

- Real user interaction revealed issues not caught in development
- Testing tools should be built alongside core functionality
- User experience trumps technical elegance

### 3. Validation Layers Matter

- Pydantic caught multiple data type issues
- Input validation prevented runtime crashes
- Clear error messages improved debugging experience

### 4. Logging and Observability

- Added logging was crucial for model verification
- Visibility into system behavior builds confidence
- Good logging makes debugging 10x faster

### 5. Windows Development Considerations

- Unicode handling in Windows terminals is tricky
- Cross-platform testing catches environment-specific issues
- Simple solutions (text vs emojis) often work better
